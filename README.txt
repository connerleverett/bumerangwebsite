#Bümerang

Bümerang (pronounced Boomerang) is a student driven project to help you when you're in a pinch. It is a real-time, mobile sharing application that allows users to easily make requests to borrow things like laptop or phone chargers.

##So, how does it work? There are two pages, 'I need it' and 'I have it'. 'I need it' are items that people near you are currently looking for, 'I have it' are items that people are generously offering to lend out!

How do I request or offer something? Simply click the plus button on the main screen and you will be prompted to enter the title of the request, a short description of the item, how far you are willing to travel to get it, and how long you need it for. The request will then appear in the 'I need it' page for others to see.

Every request is attached to the users Facebook page and phone number. Only when both parties agree on an interaction are phone numbers exchanged.
